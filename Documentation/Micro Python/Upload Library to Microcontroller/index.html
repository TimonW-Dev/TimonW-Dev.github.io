<h1>Upload Libraries and Files to a Microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico W, ESP32, ESP8266...)</h1>
<p>There are several ways to upload libraries and other files to a microcontroller. A simple method is to use the <a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny IDE</a>. You can install the Thonny IDE from the following <a href="https://thonny.org/">link</a>.</p>

<td><strong>Enable the File Manager</strong> <br> To easily transfer files between the Thonny IDE and the microcontroller, you can enable the file manager, which is hidden by default. To show the file manager, click on &quot;View&quot; in the top menu bar and then select &quot;Files&quot;. <br><br> After that, you will see the file manager appear on the left side.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Create a Library Folder</strong> <br> At the bottom of the window, you will see the files stored on the microcontroller. You can right-click there to create a folder named &quot;lib&quot; for your libraries.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Upload the Library</strong> <br> After double-clicking on the lib folder, you can upload the library you previously downloaded from your PC to the microcontroller by right-clicking and selecting &quot;Upload to /lib&quot;. <br><br> You can then import the library in your code just like you would with any standard library that comes pre-installed.</td>
